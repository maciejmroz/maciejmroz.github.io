      <description>While most of my programming life used to be centered around C++, nowadays I do not really spend much time with the language at work (other than doing code reviews). I remain big fan of C++. Despite the fact it&amp;rsquo;s not very fashionable language, it is extremely efficient and quite flexible. What&amp;rsquo;s even more important it&amp;rsquo;s continuing to evolve, and it evolves in the right direction. I took some time to try out the C++11 features refactoring small private project, and it really looks good.</description>
