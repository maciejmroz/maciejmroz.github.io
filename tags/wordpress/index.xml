      <description>Classic web is dying, even if slowly. I will write longer post about that soon. In the meantime, try to use Flipboard for a while … and you will notice that classic portals/blogs are just dinosaurs. They might not know it yet but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the facts.
If you are using WordPress, there is a cure called Onswipe. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect (in fact it is buggy as hell) but shows a lot of promise.</description>

      <description>I just got the invoice for the domain, and decided that if I&amp;rsquo;m paying for it it might at least look half-decent. I no web designer, for me it&amp;rsquo;s mostly difference between &amp;ldquo;it sucks&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;ok&amp;rdquo;, with rare addition (&amp;lt;1%) of &amp;ldquo;awesome&amp;rdquo;. This theme is &amp;ldquo;ok&amp;rdquo; and I doubt I&amp;rsquo;m going to heavily tweak it, if at all. I am also doing some experiments with Facebook integration - sharing links to post is the first to go, later hopefully commenting with Facebook account and some sort of &amp;ldquo;fanpage connect&amp;rdquo; so that anything appearing here gets automatically propagated to my FB profile.</description>

      <description>It had to happen eventually. What can one expect when running ages old WordPress installation? Anyway, someone has injected malicious JavaScript code at the end of every single post. So I deleted everything. Perhaps I overreacted a bit &amp;hellip; I have most of this stuff backed up but I am not going to waste my time recovering the backups. Life goes on.</description>
