      <description>The next generation of consoles will most likely come by the end of year 2013. One intersting question arise: how it should look like? Disclaimer: by &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; I mean &amp;ldquo;actually makes business sense for both platform holders and developers&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;what hardcore gamers would like to see&amp;rdquo;. These meanings are at quite a big conflict, as we shall see later :)
In order to think about next gen we have to take deeper look at the general trends in the entertainment industry.</description>
