      <description>They actually call it NGP, standing for Next Generation Portable. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really be suprised that much if the name was left unchanged in final product. Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some posts from respected sites saying that PSP2 is doomed, dead on arrival, etc etc &amp;hellip; which I think is completely wrong thinking. The basic problem is comparing it to a phone, usually the iPhone.
It is true that games are huge on Apple platform, and they are only going to get bigger.</description>
