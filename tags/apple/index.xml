      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next generation of consoles will most likely come by the end of year 2013. One intersting question arise: how it &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; look like? Disclaimer: by &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; I mean &amp;ldquo;actually makes business sense for both platform holders and developers&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;what hardcore gamers would like to see&amp;rdquo;. These meanings are at quite a big conflict, as we shall see later :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to think about next gen we have to take deeper look at the general trends in the entertainment industry. Some of these trends were not significant at X360/PS3 launch, some did not even exist at the time. The world has radically changed in the past few years, invalidating many assumptions entire console industry was built on. As a reminder, the classic console business model is based on selling hardware at a loss in order to build userbase and later getting the money back in the form of licensing fees (which implies absolute control over platform). Traditionally, consoles were very powerful at release - comparable to very good gaming PC. Other than cost optimizations and physical layout, during lifetime of a console hardware specifications are fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This provided value to customers in two ways: one way was getting very powerful hardware at a discounted price, and second was getting stable hardware configuration that is guaranteed to be compatible with every game released for the system. Of course, console gamers eventually end up paying more than PC gamers but because it is spread over long long time, it&amp;rsquo;s something people generally tend to overlook. It&amp;rsquo;s all great - if it works. However, if the console doesn&amp;rsquo;t get enough traction it is a financial disaster. Developing custom hardware and operating system is insanely costly and time consuming. We&amp;rsquo;re not only talking custom boards and software here - we&amp;rsquo;re talking CPU/GPU design! At launch, instead of starting to make money on the console, &lt;strong&gt;even more&lt;/strong&gt; money is spent. It&amp;rsquo;s a huge risk to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsidizing the hardware is something that was already put into doubt at the very beginning of the current console cycle by Nintendo. Wii was never sold at a loss, allowing the profit to be made on both games and hardware itself. It is reasonable to assume that designing the Wii was a lot cheaper than designing PS3/X360 - essentially is was slightly beefed up Gamecube with a new controller. Obviously, the break even point for Nintendo was much lower than for Sony/Microsoft, something I am sure both companies noticed. What everyone noticed is that there&amp;rsquo;s huge group of people who didn&amp;rsquo;t mind worse graphics quality, and didn&amp;rsquo;t care about HD that much. I am not trying to convince anyone here that better graphics and all other stuff brought by high performance hardware do not matter. They do. But with every hardware generation the group of people who care is actually smaller and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now some personal observation. While I do not play games on a PC that much, I managed to notice one thing related to console cycles. Every time game console is released PC players say &amp;ldquo;wow!&amp;rdquo; (deep inside, of course, no PC gamer will openly admit that :) ). Shortly (a year or so later) PC hardware and games are roughly the same quality. Fast forward two years and PC games are vastly superior (this is the moment when PC gamers proudly bash console gamers in public :) ). Finally, when new console generation arrives, everyone says &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s about time&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t see this cycle happening right now &amp;hellip; sure, there are some DX11 titles that look very good (and look at tech demos from companies like Epic and Crytek!) but I don&amp;rsquo;t see people agonizing over the need for new GPU, or even complete system. Also, I don&amp;rsquo;t see people getting excited about new chips from AMD/Nvidia or new Intel CPUs. Hardcore gamers might still be in denial, but I&amp;rsquo;ll say it anyway: graphics quality is at the stage where providing even small gains in user experience requires expotential growth in computing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make people say &amp;ldquo;wow!&amp;rdquo; again next gen systems would need &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;. How much? For starters, we need to double GPU power just to port existing content to 1080p. I&amp;rsquo;d say that for a meaningful boost in quality, we&amp;rsquo;d also need 4x programmable shading performance on top of that - so 8x the GPU performance as a bare minimum. It&amp;rsquo;s safe to assume we&amp;rsquo;d also need a lot more memory - just boosting the texture resolution 2x requires 4x the memory. But we&amp;rsquo;d want to have HDR rendering pipeline. Ooops, that&amp;rsquo;s bigger framebuffer, and probably some HDR textures. Not to mention a lot of modern rendering techniques require floating point buffers and textures anyway. Add more geometry storage, too (even if in the form of displacement maps). So, going &amp;ldquo;the old way&amp;rdquo; next gen console would need at least 4GB of total memory and 2TFLOPS of programmable GPU, all that paired with significantly faster CPU. This is doable even today, but even if you ignore costs, there is another catch in here, and that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; power consumption. The correct way of thinking about CPU/GPU today is only one: performance/Watt. Fitting above spec within 200W envelope is going to be very challenging, even with 22nm CPU/GPU process. Can Sony/MS take a risk and go with a lot more powerful hardware at the expense of noise and power usage? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. But that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what they would have to do make games significantly better looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now look for a while at the development side of things. Some game budgets are already in line with Hollywood movies. Next gen as described above would require a lot more content, and new content production pipelines. Insane budgets would only get bigger &amp;hellip; There&amp;rsquo;s room for very few blockbusters out there, and even for them the business is getting tougher and tougher. Money and effort is likely to naturally flow in the direction of lower risk and higher ROI, and might mean moving away from traditional consoles. It&amp;rsquo;s not like developers don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice. In fact, right now developers have more choice than ever! First of all, there&amp;rsquo;s iOS and Android, in both smartphone and tablet form factors. These platforms have relatively low barriers to entry and and are natural target for small/medium development teams. There&amp;rsquo;s also Steam on PC, along with some smaller online stores. Last but not least, there&amp;rsquo;s Facebook, along with smaller social networks. Any of these are (from developer point of view) better platforms than XBox or PlayStation. That&amp;rsquo;s something significant even for big players in the industry. Simply speaking it&amp;rsquo;s better to invest in 5-10 small projects than in single big project - it is likely that some of the small projects will perform below expectations, or even fail, but at the same time it is unlikely that the entire investment portfolio will be a loser because the risk will be highly diversified. A portfolio of big projects is more and more like playing poker with your entire bankroll on table &amp;hellip; Current state of THQ clearly shows what the effects can be - positive expected value is not enough to gamble with hundreds of milions of dollars (although some investment bankers thought differently :) ). Platform without support of developers is a dead platform, and developing for consoles in the classic model is not really attractive any more from business point of view. XBLA and PSN might still be a viable target platform, but as they are it&amp;rsquo;s harder and harder to justify making any of them the lead platform - what we see more and more is that game gets launched on iOS/Android/Steam/Facebook and then possibly ported to consoles, not vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is the era of dedicated gaming devices coming to an end?</title>
      <link>/2012/02/22/is-the-era-of-dedicated-gaming-devices-coming-to-an-end/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was the day when PlayStation Vita launched worldwide. I had the chance to play most of the launch games already during GDC Europe last August and I think that both hardware and launch lineup are impressive. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy PS Vita on launch. It&amp;rsquo;s probably a very sad day for Sony, bacause &amp;ldquo;PlayStation&amp;rdquo; is my religion (on Facebook, at least :) ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happended? I faced the truth - mainstream mobile gaming is already on Android and iOS, and a lot of titles are released every day. I know that every single developer out there is working on these platforms, and they don&amp;rsquo;t mind selling the game for $1-$5. You can&amp;rsquo;t possibly deny the trends - these devices are the new player in the console market. Just a few months ago I have written (on this blog) that there&amp;rsquo;s not much danger to Vita from the iOS/Android camp. I hate to admit that, but I might have been wrong. Yes, phones and tablets might lose on overall experience, but at the same time they win hands down when it goes to price and convenience. I actually found myself playing games on both iPhone and iPad in past six months or so. And I enjoyed doing it, at least for a short while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean Vita is dead on arrival. It&amp;rsquo;s the best portable gaming device Sony (or anyone) could possibly make and a lot of people will buy it. But they will be the most hardcore of the hardcore gamers. Others will settle for the simple and easy solution, sometimes even being fully aware of what they are sacrificing - it all really comes down to the added value. Some cannibalization is bound to happen. Will the remaining group of true gamers be big enough to make PS Vita a viable platform for developers? I hope so. I actually hope that PS Vita will sell a lot more than PSP. If not, we&amp;rsquo;ll end up with a platform that has 2-3 good releases a year &amp;hellip; and that&amp;rsquo;s my biggest fear. You don&amp;rsquo;t buy console at launch because of the launch titles only. You buy the console because of the future games. Lots of them. And I am not sure they are coming :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a gamer I want truly epic experiences. PS Vita has the potential to provide them, potential that might be lost because of where the game industry is going. We are going towards simpler and shallower games, towards replacing challenge with compulsion loops, and towards freemium as a dominating business model &amp;hellip; where&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;epic&lt;/strong&gt; in that?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What will happen to Nintendo after the Wii, and more</title>
      <link>/2011/04/16/what-will-happen-to-nintendo-after-the-wii-and-more/</link>

      <guid>/2011/04/16/what-will-happen-to-nintendo-after-the-wii-and-more/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wii is nearing the end of life. Sure, there is huge installed base of consoles, but I bet that average Wii user does not buy as many games as PS3 or X360 user. Which means that from publisher/developer point of view overall value of all the Nintendo consoles out there is not as great as raw numbers would suggest. Sony and Microsoft are both doing well, and Nintendo is no longer outselling them. It is very likely that in 2011 Wii end up in the third place in terms of new consoles sold. I am sure Nintendo is aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the biggest threat to Nintendo right now is not Sony or Microsoft, but Apple. &amp;ldquo;Hey, but we are talking Wii, not 3DS, remember?&amp;rdquo;. I certainly do. I also remember that Apple TV runs iOS and Apple A4 chip. Apple did not open it to developers. Yet. And how long do you think before that happens? A5 is a lot more powerful chip, add a real controller and you end up with &amp;hellip; something resembling &amp;ldquo;Wii HD&amp;rdquo;? Apple mobile hardware is far away from catching up to PS3/X360 now, but because Nintendo sells what effectively is GameCube 1.5, they do not have the horsepower advantage. All that Apple really needs to get the ball rolling is to create wireless controller for Apple TV. A touch pad, perhaps with analog sticks and a few extra buttons? Perhaps ability to use iPhone/iPod Touch as a controller? This wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be exactly &amp;ldquo;game console&amp;rdquo;, more &amp;ldquo;a device to run apps on the TV&amp;rdquo;. With ton of games among them. A device that you can plug under your TV, that you can play games on, and one that does not come from any of the &amp;ldquo;big three&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If AppStore business model hits the TV, the one being hurt most by such move will be Nintendo because of their &amp;ldquo;softcore gamer&amp;rdquo; audience. At least initially, because in longer term this is just as much disruptive to Sony and MS. This is why Nintendo is hard pressed to release the Wii HD, and this time they can&amp;rsquo;t avoid the arms race. They really need that 1080p, tons of textures and shaders - visuals that will put X360/PS3 to shame, but more importantly will make next gen A5-based Apple TV obsolete at launch. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is enough to stop Apple, but seems like a reasonable short term move. Is Apple really going this way? I would, but I&amp;rsquo;m not Steve Jobs :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple TV is marginal device right now, but empowering it with AppStore might completely change that. AppStore has almost zero barrier to entry compared to current generation of game consoles, and 70:30 revenue split is probably generous compared to what you currently get when doing console games. There is the &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; of application prices - typical $1-$3 range is far down even from downloadable PSN games, but it&amp;rsquo;s not like there&amp;rsquo;s no place for more expensive and more complicated titles on iOS. Also, iOS games are not expected to last for 40 hours. They are just &amp;ldquo;snacks&amp;rdquo; that take 2-3 hours at most to complete, and then you move on. Which means iOS users do not neccessarily spend a lot less on games than console gamers. When I buy DVD/Blu-Ray with game, about $8 of the money I spend reaches the developer - the rest is split between publisher and in the distribution chain. So when I spend $12 on online purchases via AppStore, similar amount of money reaches developers. Also, freemium model is absolutely possible and already used by many. Because of that, iOS has guaranteed developer support for the forseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things might get a lot more interesting down the road. We know that Sony NGP will feature quad-core ARM and very powerful GPU. This year we will have mobile hardware that is not very far behind PS3. This means that it is likely that by the end of 2012 Apple might be able to build iOS device that actually is more powerful than the PS3. They have been hiring some game industry people recently. See where all this is going?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What to expect from iPad 2</title>
      <link>/2011/01/20/what-to-expect-from-ipad-2/</link>

      <guid>/2011/01/20/what-to-expect-from-ipad-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before CES, I&amp;rsquo;d say &amp;ldquo;not much&amp;rdquo;. The thing is, today Apple owns the tablet market (if defined as dedicated hardware running dedicated OS), there is almost no competition out there. But it is on the horizon. Take Motorola Xoom as an example. Hardware specs are way beyond iPad 1.0, and if Android 3.0 is going to be that good as people claim, Apple is going to be in real trouble if they release underpowered device. And there will be more and more Android tablets as we go deeper into 2011 &amp;hellip; My guesses for iPad 2 are: SD card slot, front facing camera, and 1GB of RAM. SD card slot is fairly cheap way to greatly improve the device, and is very much in line with intended use - something that would replace laptop for basic photo management tasks. Front facing camera - not much point to discuss. Memory is more interesting - a month ago I&amp;rsquo;d bet on 512 MB, exactly the same as in iPhone 4. But after CES it just sounds cheap and limited. Apple has tradition of selling as little as they can for as much as possible, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really think they can get away with that. I think this is very moderate spec that should be considered basis for more. Retina display? Dual core CPU? Faster GPU? USB slot? They need another iPhone 4, and this time without the antennagate. Right now, after CES, anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Apple Tablet</title>
      <link>/2010/02/06/apple-ipad-first-thoughts/</link>

      <guid>/2010/02/06/apple-ipad-first-thoughts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apple tablet is no longer a mystery. The question now is whether it meets the expectations or fits any real needs :) Basically it is an oversized iPhone - 1024x768 multitouch display, 16-64 GB of flash memory, 1 GHz custom CPU, WiFi, Bluetooth etc, and it runs iPhone OS. I already have an iPhone. Is iPad going to perform better enough to justify buying additional device?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GMail support with push in the iPhone is most of the time sufficient for me. I rarely reply to mails directly from my iPhone, though. If something requires longer answer I usually just use normal computer for that. iPads bigger screen (and bigger virtual keyboard as a result) will surely improve experience here. I can actually imagine writing emails using this thing. Web browsing is where iPad is going to be a lot better than iPhone simply because of screen size and CPU performance (one of the things I noticed immediately at Apple videos is how smooth it runs, it&amp;rsquo;s super fast!). Web and mail if work well might alone be a selling point for people who don&amp;rsquo;t keep &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; computer at home and actually do turn it on and off. In that scenario iPad is going to be very useful, offering browsing and mail experience very close to &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo; but with instant access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iTunes for music/video/podcasts is nice for people living in the US, I imagine. Apple still has not fully acknowledged existence of Poland, so for me this functionality is not very attractive, simply because it does not work. Of course I can transcode videos and use MP3 for music but that&amp;rsquo;s hardly the experience it should be. For watching video I don&amp;rsquo;t think it can realistically beat big LCD TV, I know that there are some VGA/composite adapters (sold separately), but what I&amp;rsquo;d really like to see is just HDMI output. Or perhaps built in DLNA media server? Both would solve the problem of &amp;ldquo;how to put it on large screen&amp;rdquo;, second one is wireless, which in my dictionary is almost the same as &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photo functionality is nice but crippled at the very beginning by the hardware - iPad does not have SD card slot nor USB port. What may be the most attractive usage is loading the photos directly from my camera into the iPad, tag them, rate, sort, delete ones I don&amp;rsquo;t like, upload to Facebook etc. It will be possible but will require additional &amp;ldquo;camera connection kit&amp;rdquo;. Not including these ports by default it strange to say the least. Perhaps they are already planning revised hardware version late this year, and that&amp;rsquo;s just sinister plan to make people buy new hardware in longer term :). Anyway, I really do see the potential here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iBookstore was obviously going to happen - and I think it is very good it did. It will put a lot of pressure on ebook reader market. I am not entirely convinced on using active IPS display for reading, in the end it is not that much different from staring at the lamp for a long time. Theoretically e-ink displays have an advantage here, and if you try using iRex Iliad (for example) then yes, its display technology is awesome in terms of ease of reading. At the same time, everything else is far from great. Iliad is slow, takes ages to start up, and again ages to load large pdf files, page turning is sluggish, battery life is not so great, and overall user interface is far from easy to navigate. If Apple really can get 10 hours of battery life from iPad (and one month of standby!), while running active high resolution color display, it clearly shows that there is something wrong with all ebook readers released to market so far. This really reminds me of what Apple did to cell phone market. Perhaps they did not built perfect device but still managed to do something better than everyone else. Again, I see a lot of potential here. I&amp;rsquo;d really like to buy books in electronic rather than physical form, but I guess there&amp;rsquo;s long time before that really happens. What is needed is immediate availability of electronic version along with print release, and availability of electronic version of every single book out there. None of these is happening today, probably not even in the US. We&amp;rsquo;ll get there in a few years. Printing industry is insanely wasteful and while I do not care about the environment that much in general, when I can do something environmentally friendly and convenient at the same time - I am all for it. For now, I only want to know if I can upload pdf files directly to the iPad - I might not be able to use it to read commercial books, but there surely is tons of technical documentation, presentations etc that I might want to read on the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One glaring omission I think everyone considered almost a given before iPad announcement is front facing camera. It means no video conferencing. Perhaps it has something to do with unlimited 3G data plans Apple and AT&amp;T; are offering in the US? Anyway I do see it as a shortcoming, and something surely to be corrected in future hardware release (and everyone will go and buy themselves a new iPad &amp;hellip; Apple is thinking long term here :) ). Network connectivity is where it manages to do very well. 802.11n + Bluetooth 2.1 is very good, built in 3G modem is also nice. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing more to want here. I&amp;rsquo;d only like to know if I can use iPhone as Bluetooth modem for non-3G iPad. The price difference between 3G and non-3G versions is significant and I can&amp;rsquo;t really imagine scenario when I am mobile and without my phone. So why two SIM cards? Seems logical that in this case I should simply be able to go with WiFi-only version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple did not forget about productivity apps, and I am sure there will be more with time. However this is where you really need multitasking. iWork applications are ok, but in reality you are switching between these apps and email/web/skype/calculator/pdf reader etc. Non to mention listening to music in background. Which means we are left with very basic functionality. That can be fixed with OS update, at the cost of battery life (which Apple seems to be defending very aggressively). In the end, iPad is no replacement for a laptop or PC/Mac, although to be fair I have to say that it does not try to be one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of doing simple tasks on simple device leads me to another question: do people still need a PC/laptop? Think about it: typical people mostly consume media, what they produce (outside of work) is rather simplistic: photos, videos, some blog posts. They also need basic calendar/todo list, perhaps money management application. Add to this the trend of moving more and more online and running it inside a web browser (obviously a model supported by iPad) and we are soon approaching the world where all of typical stuff people do can be done using one simple device, probably looking a lot like the iPad. I believe it indeed is a new device category, that takes away some of the tasks we so far are used to do on personal computer. I see very strong analogy to game consoles here, btw. I do not play typical &amp;ldquo;3D&amp;rdquo; games on my computer any more. Sure I&amp;rsquo;ll use it to play Civilization, but for most games the console is just better. It&amp;rsquo;s likely going to be the same with iPad, but this time what&amp;rsquo;s left of the personal computer may no longer be necessary for many people.&lt;/p&gt;
