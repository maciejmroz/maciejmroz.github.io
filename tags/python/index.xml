      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve had our first internal hackaton recently at Ganymede. We don&amp;rsquo;t have &amp;ldquo;20% time&amp;rdquo; rule or anything like that, so the entire thing was a huge experiment. What we did was to take not one, but two days (Thursday and Friday) off our normal schedule to allow people do some cool stuff.Obviosly, because we are a game development company, most teams decided to a game. With all my responsibilities, I did not commit to any team, but decided to do small project on my own - to last minute I did not actually know if I would be tied up in other stuff or not.</description>
