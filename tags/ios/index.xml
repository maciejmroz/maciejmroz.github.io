      <description>If you ever tried to get deeper into it than just looking at press releases about &amp;ldquo;HTML5 companies&amp;rdquo; who just received some VC funding, it is indeed very interesting question. Let&amp;rsquo;s put aside the idea of building entire business on HTML5 tools/engines. What I want to touch to today is the topic of the technology in general, and it&amp;rsquo;s comparison with possible alternatives. Important distinction here - it&amp;rsquo;s about 2D casual games.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been an IPhone user for loong time. While I did not own the &amp;ldquo;1G&amp;rdquo;, I have my 3G for more than two years now. And, to be honest, it begins to show its age. For quite some time, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting any of the new cool stuff in iOS, and iOS version 4 actually should have never been released on iPhone 3G because it makes a lot of stuff run noticeably slower.</description>
