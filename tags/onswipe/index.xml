      <description>&lt;p&gt;Classic web is dying, even if slowly. I will write longer post about that soon. In the meantime, try to use Flipboard for a while … and you will notice that classic portals/blogs are just dinosaurs. They might not know it yet but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using WordPress, there is a cure called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.onswipe.com&#34;&gt;Onswipe&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect (in fact it is buggy as hell) but shows a lot of promise. Onswipe is a WordPress plugin that provides Flipboard-like experience on an IPad using HTML5. Enter this blog from an iPad, and you will enter completely different world. I suppose it should also work on Android tablets, after all it&amp;rsquo;s just HTML. Onswipe is interesting for two resons. The first reason (and the reason for it&amp;rsquo;s existence) is that it essentially changes website into an &lt;strong&gt;application&lt;/strong&gt;. The second reason it is interesting is because these guys got &lt;a href=&#34;http://venturebeat.com/2011/06/03/onswipe-funding/&#34;&gt;$5M in funding&lt;/a&gt; to write a WordPress plugin :) Which leads to following conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There might be another bubble forming, this time around anything with &amp;ldquo;mobile&amp;rdquo; in name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I live in a wrong country :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
