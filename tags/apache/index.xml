      <description>The title says it all, but I probably still should paint some background to this article. Imagine a system where you need very high performance, you need it yesterday, and you don&amp;rsquo;t have infinite funds to simply throw more hardware at the problem. Very important component in this system is a web server. Very simple requests, always generated by code (while system in question does not provide data to end users, you can think of AJAX - definitely there&amp;rsquo;s a similarity).</description>
