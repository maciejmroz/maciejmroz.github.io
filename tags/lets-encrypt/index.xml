      <description>If you are backend engineer, you probably treat nonfunctional requirements like security, availability, scalability etc. just as if they were laws of physics. And that&amp;rsquo;s good when working on mature, mission critical systems. But what if you don&amp;rsquo;t need all that and want to simply focus on getting something simple but professionally looking out there? Something like MVP/early stage product?
Do you really need microservices, containers, service discovery, load balancers, caches, multiple databases, all clustered and replicated accross multiple availability zones?</description>

      <description>Quite a chunk of time has passed since my last update to this blog. While primary reason is my super busy life (on both proffessional and personal fronts) there was also another one I have finally addressed, along with a few extras. The reason was that over the years I simply grew tired of WordPress software. The point to migrate away from it occupied my TODO list for too long. I am not going to bash WP here, I used it for many years, and for that I am grateful to its authors.</description>
