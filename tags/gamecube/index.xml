      <description>Wii is nearing the end of life. Sure, there is huge installed base of consoles, but I bet that average Wii user does not buy as many games as PS3 or X360 user. Which means that from publisher/developer point of view overall value of all the Nintendo consoles out there is not as great as raw numbers would suggest. Sony and Microsoft are both doing well, and Nintendo is no longer outselling them.</description>
