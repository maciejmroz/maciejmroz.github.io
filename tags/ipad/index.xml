      <description>Before CES, I&amp;rsquo;d say &amp;ldquo;not much&amp;rdquo;. The thing is, today Apple owns the tablet market (if defined as dedicated hardware running dedicated OS), there is almost no competition out there. But it is on the horizon. Take Motorola Xoom as an example. Hardware specs are way beyond iPad 1.0, and if Android 3.0 is going to be that good as people claim, Apple is going to be in real trouble if they release underpowered device.</description>

      <description>Apple tablet is no longer a mystery. The question now is whether it meets the expectations or fits any real needs :) Basically it is an oversized iPhone - 1024x768 multitouch display, 16-64 GB of flash memory, 1 GHz custom CPU, WiFi, Bluetooth etc, and it runs iPhone OS. I already have an iPhone. Is iPad going to perform better enough to justify buying additional device?
GMail support with push in the iPhone is most of the time sufficient for me.</description>
