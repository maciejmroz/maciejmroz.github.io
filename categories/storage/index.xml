      <description>It was quite some time ago when my company started using Fusion-IO (enterprise SSDs) on our database servers. We are happily using them till this day. The great part is that we could scale vertically and leave software layer unchanged. Even better: we still have room for growth, despite getting more users and our application stack getting more and more demanding. We were one of the first to switch to SSDs on server side - so right now it&amp;rsquo;s interesting that this idea propagated so quickly.</description>
