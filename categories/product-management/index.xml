      <description>A little story today. It goes like this. I drop by one of our teams, and within completely different discussion I get asked this very &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; question:
 &amp;ldquo;Can we overlay an actual development team cost on top of product revenues so that we know if we are in the red or in the green?&amp;rdquo;
 If you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed yet, there&amp;rsquo;s a flaw in this question. The problem is, it simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense from economic point of view.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, while having a casual conversation over a beer, I was totally shocked when I heard something close to: &amp;ldquo;A/B testing is pointless on small project like ours because testing overhead is too high&amp;rdquo;. Is it? Let&amp;rsquo;s run the numbers :) Assumptions:
 The product costs X to operate monthly. 70% of the costs are development team, and 30% is administrative overhead and other costs like infrastructure, customer support and marketing expenses.</description>
