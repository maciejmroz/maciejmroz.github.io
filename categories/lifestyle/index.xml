      <description>Yesterday I was talking to my Dad on Skype about the book I just finished reading. The book title was &amp;ldquo;Running Lean&amp;rdquo; and it is a very good take on the lean approach to product development/management originally made popular by Eric Ries. What struck me was that while I was talking, my Dad suddenly interrupted me and asked a simple question: &amp;ldquo;Are you a marketing guy now?&amp;rdquo;. Of course I denied, it just sounded completely bizarre and out of place!</description>

      <description>OMG! Another one who promises to lose weight in 2012, please kill me now! Worry not, it&amp;rsquo;s quite the opposite :) Also, while it might be a bit suprising, there will be only one resolution. I will not promise anyone to lose weight. What&amp;rsquo;s more, I will not promise to: exercise, drink less alcohol, sleep 8 hours a day, control my finances, go to specific place, or do whatever else.</description>
