      <description>Recently I somehow found enough time to read &amp;ldquo;OpenGL SuperBible, 5th edition&amp;rdquo;. It was something done purely for fun, just to see how things are looking today for modern graphics APIs. Last time I did any serious graphics programming, OpenGL was slowly dying.
In fact, my M.Sc. thesis used Direct3D as implementation API. I simply had no choice. There was no standard for anything - every single important feature was exposed through extensions.</description>
