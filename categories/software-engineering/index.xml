      <description>I was recently confronted with very interesting misconception: that Agile and SCRUM are the same thing. It really got me thinking. First, it means that one must be very careful when using the word &amp;ldquo;agile&amp;rdquo; in software development context. Less obvious: SCRUM is de facto standard agile method today, and very often the only one people know or heard about.
Wikipedia lists 10+ different methods falling under &amp;ldquo;Agile&amp;rdquo; umbrella. It&amp;rsquo;s no suprise because agile manifesto is very vague and does not really tell much (if anything) about the how part.</description>
