      <description>Some introductory note: I&amp;rsquo;ve written this post before reading Lean Startup by Eric Ries. Recently I finally found time to do it and &amp;hellip; I wish this book existed five years ago :) The problems I describe below are not unique. If what you read resonates with you in any way, go and read the book - it explains these ideas in a lot greater detail, touching on some more complicated subjects like product life cycle and company structure.</description>
