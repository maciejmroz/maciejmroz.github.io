      <description>Today was the day when PlayStation Vita launched worldwide. I had the chance to play most of the launch games already during GDC Europe last August and I think that both hardware and launch lineup are impressive. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy PS Vita on launch. It&amp;rsquo;s probably a very sad day for Sony, bacause &amp;ldquo;PlayStation&amp;rdquo; is my religion (on Facebook, at least :) ).
What happended? I faced the truth - mainstream mobile gaming is already on Android and iOS, and a lot of titles are released every day.</description>

      <description>People keep talking about &amp;ldquo;mobile&amp;rdquo;, how it&amp;rsquo;s going to be very important (i.e. &amp;ldquo;we have mobile first policy&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip;) but recently it really struck me: most talking about mobile revolution have abolutely no idea. They just don&amp;rsquo;t get it. Which is a bit sad, actually, especially if you think that big media companies are still struggling to make sense of what to do with classic, web-based Internet. Mobile is a revolution can only be understood by mobile users.</description>
