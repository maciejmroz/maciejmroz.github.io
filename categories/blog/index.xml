      <description>Quite a chunk of time has passed since my last update to this blog. While primary reason is my super busy life (on both proffessional and personal fronts) there was also another one I have finally addressed, along with a few extras. The reason was that over the years I simply grew tired of WordPress software. The point to migrate away from it occupied my TODO list for too long. I am not going to bash WP here, I used it for many years, and for that I am grateful to its authors.</description>

      <description>Classic web is dying, even if slowly. I will write longer post about that soon. In the meantime, try to use Flipboard for a while … and you will notice that classic portals/blogs are just dinosaurs. They might not know it yet but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the facts.
If you are using WordPress, there is a cure called Onswipe. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect (in fact it is buggy as hell) but shows a lot of promise.</description>

      <description>I just got the invoice for the domain, and decided that if I&amp;rsquo;m paying for it it might at least look half-decent. I no web designer, for me it&amp;rsquo;s mostly difference between &amp;ldquo;it sucks&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;ok&amp;rdquo;, with rare addition (&amp;lt;1%) of &amp;ldquo;awesome&amp;rdquo;. This theme is &amp;ldquo;ok&amp;rdquo; and I doubt I&amp;rsquo;m going to heavily tweak it, if at all. I am also doing some experiments with Facebook integration - sharing links to post is the first to go, later hopefully commenting with Facebook account and some sort of &amp;ldquo;fanpage connect&amp;rdquo; so that anything appearing here gets automatically propagated to my FB profile.</description>
