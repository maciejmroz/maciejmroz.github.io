      <description>The next generation of consoles will most likely come by the end of year 2013. One intersting question arise: how it should look like? Disclaimer: by &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; I mean &amp;ldquo;actually makes business sense for both platform holders and developers&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;what hardcore gamers would like to see&amp;rdquo;. These meanings are at quite a big conflict, as we shall see later :)
In order to think about next gen we have to take deeper look at the general trends in the entertainment industry.</description>

      <description>Today was the day when PlayStation Vita launched worldwide. I had the chance to play most of the launch games already during GDC Europe last August and I think that both hardware and launch lineup are impressive. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy PS Vita on launch. It&amp;rsquo;s probably a very sad day for Sony, bacause &amp;ldquo;PlayStation&amp;rdquo; is my religion (on Facebook, at least :) ).
What happended? I faced the truth - mainstream mobile gaming is already on Android and iOS, and a lot of titles are released every day.</description>

      <description>Wii is nearing the end of life. Sure, there is huge installed base of consoles, but I bet that average Wii user does not buy as many games as PS3 or X360 user. Which means that from publisher/developer point of view overall value of all the Nintendo consoles out there is not as great as raw numbers would suggest. Sony and Microsoft are both doing well, and Nintendo is no longer outselling them.</description>

      <title>Why PSP2 is going to succeed</title>

      <description>They actually call it NGP, standing for Next Generation Portable. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really be suprised that much if the name was left unchanged in final product. Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some posts from respected sites saying that PSP2 is doomed, dead on arrival, etc etc &amp;hellip; which I think is completely wrong thinking. The basic problem is comparing it to a phone, usually the iPhone.
It is true that games are huge on Apple platform, and they are only going to get bigger.</description>
