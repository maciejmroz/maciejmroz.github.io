      <description>Just like many others, in 2012 I spent significant amount of time playing Diablo 3. While I enjoyed the experience a lot, playing the game also pushed me to think about its design. What I found most interesting was random loot system and auction house. Because of that, I recently started to think if I can produce simplified model of virtual currency economy in a game with random loot. Now, one very important caveat: I did not try to model Blizzard’s game.</description>

      <description>If you ever tried to get deeper into it than just looking at press releases about &amp;ldquo;HTML5 companies&amp;rdquo; who just received some VC funding, it is indeed very interesting question. Let&amp;rsquo;s put aside the idea of building entire business on HTML5 tools/engines. What I want to touch to today is the topic of the technology in general, and it&amp;rsquo;s comparison with possible alternatives. Important distinction here - it&amp;rsquo;s about 2D casual games.</description>
