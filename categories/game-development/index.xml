      <description>Just like many others, in 2012 I spent significant amount of time playing Diablo 3. While I enjoyed the experience a lot, playing the game also pushed me to think about its design.

Because of that, I recently started to think if I can produce simplified model of virtual currency economy in a game with random loot. Now, one very important caveat: I did not try to model Blizzard’s game.</description>
